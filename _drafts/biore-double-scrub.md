I've been a loyal fan of [St. Ives Apricot Scrub](http://www.amazon.com/Ives-Scrub-Fresh-Skin-Apricot/dp/B000UVY8IE) for years. I saw a few articles where people believe it's damaging for your skin. Personally I've used the product gently and I've also scrubbed as hard as I could. I didn't really notice a huge difference. Anyway it was time for a change anyway.

I picked up [Biore Mens Double Scrub](http://www.amazon.com/BIORE-MENS-Double-Scrub-Face/dp/B004QEZ3X0). I know Biore is most known for their nose strips :nose:, but I figured they have to know something about the whole face right?

I've been using this scrub about 2/3 times a week. I usually don't scrub too hard and it feels like it does take away most of the oil from my skin. Usually I can see my pores are on my nose are bumpy but afterwards, it's pretty smooth.
