I'm not sure why we are extra motivated to work on ourself at the beginning of the year. Why not set goals for ourselves
throughout the year? Well I don't remember my goals from last year... So here are mine for this year.

I'm planning to use this update my progress on my goals and maybe add some.

This year I want to accomplish and why:

### Learn Chinese

### Deeper Friendships

### Own Something
