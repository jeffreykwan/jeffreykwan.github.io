I've never really been a new years resolution type of person. Every year people ask and I come up with a few.
I usually don't write them down or plan a way to achieve them. I feel like last year I didn't really make an effort
to set any goals. I was really career oriented and I'm extremely grateful for opportunities I had in 2015.

How about a change for 2016. :bowtie:

I've decided to set some resolutions outside of work, maybe as the year goes on I might add some work related resolutions.
I'm going to regularly post updates on my resolutions on this blog. Also it might be nice to look back on one day.

This year I would like to accomplish the following:

**1) Learn to read, write and speak basic Chinese**  
*Stretch:* Have a basic conversation
*Conservative:*  Not be totally dependent on english subtitles for shows

**2) Reconnect with old friends & be closer to existing ones**

**3) Work Out**  
*Stretch:* 3 times a week  
*Conservative:* 2 times a week

**5) Take more Pictures**

**6) Wake up earlier**  
*Stretch:* Before 9  
*Conservative:* Before 9:40

**7) Work on a side project**  
*Stretch:* Write an app  
*Conservative:* An open sourced project

**8) Take a month long vacation**

**9) Make steps towards being a homeowner**
