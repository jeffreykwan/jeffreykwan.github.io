Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm a software engineer at a start up. Basically like everybody else in the Bay Area. I primarily work in the front-end, I :purple_heart: JavaScript lol.

I created this blog to talk about my experiences in my professional career (don't worry I'll keep the nerdy details out), lifestyle choices, random product reviews and fashion trends I've fallen into. :information_desk_person:

Yeah pretty metro :train: but hopefully some posts will be informative. Among my friends, I'm usually known as the guy that falls asleep at every social gathering.  

I built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and made a few styling changes to [Type Theme](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/).

Thanks for reading! :grin:
